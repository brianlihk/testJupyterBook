## Introduction
Operator could help computer to decide if A and B value is true or false in operator.
For example 1 is greater than 0, we can express it as 1>0, python will return us a true value. But if we try 0>1, the result will be false as it is a false statement.

## Operator form
There are two types of operator, one for calcalating called Aritgmetic operator, the other one called comparison were for comparing left and right side to return if it is a true or false statement.

### Arithmetic
| operator | explain | example | japanese |
| :------: | :------ | :------ | :------: |
| + | add | a + b | 加算 |
| - | subtract | a - b | 減算 |
| * | multiply | a * b | 乗算 |
| / | devide | a / b ｜ 除算 |
| % | modulus. This will return the leftover value when b devided by a | a % b | 余り |
### Comparison
| operator | explain | example |
| :------: | :------ | :------ |
| > | greater than | a > b |
| >= | greater or equal to | a >= b|
| < | less than | a < b |
| <= | less or equal to | a <= b |
| == | equal to | a == b |
| != | not equal to | a != b |
| ! | not | !a == !b |
