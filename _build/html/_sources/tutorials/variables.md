## Introduction
Variables are used to store value in diffenert data types (types will be fully explaned in next page). We can define a name into a variable and stores data such as numbers, strings, float, and etc inside.

## Definiting rules
There are some rule for defining the variable name:
1. the name must not start with number
2. no space between words

## Naming format
And for bouns, if we have a variable name that contains more than one word, we will define it like this: firstSecondThirt, this could keep the variable name more likely to readable and in a constant format.

## Example
Try the example below, it will define and print the variable out

<pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
age = 73
ageIfHeIsStillAlive = 206
name = "Don Bosco"

print(name, age, ageIfHeIsStillAlive)
</pre>
