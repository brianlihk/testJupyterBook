## Introduction
Data type is in of the most important thing among all programming language, each of them had their own property and something it will overlaps other's. It is extremely important to select which data type you are going to use to avoid any error, not everyone of them is nice to other.

## Data types form
| Name | Example value | transform to |
| :-----: | :-----------: | :-------: |
| String  | "This is a string" | str(x) |
| Integer | 5234          | int(x)|
| Float   | 293.1234      | float(x)|
| Boolean | True / False  | N/A |

And there are more advenced data type to be introduced in advence class!

## How to define a variable and assign it with correct data type
This is more about experience in my opinion, i prefer you to study and try more on python or programming to master the skill. But since this is a tutorial class, I should teach you atleat the basics of it.

In general, we should decide the data should contain string or numbers, if it's string, congrats your problem is solved. But if you have to deal with numbers, ask yourself if you need floating point number or just integer, or if you are lazy you can just use float since float can also carries integer, sort of.


## In practical, how to define a variable
But you are lucky enough to learn python. Python does not requires you to define the exact data type like java or C. You need to define the variable name in order to declare the variable, it will change the shape of what you assign into.

Let's talk no more and try, try is the best to learn programming.

<pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
exampleVariable = ""
print(exampleVariable)
</pre>

Now we have a variable called exampleVariable assigned with value "", which is a string but it contains no charater in it.

## Pre-assign value into variable
If you are smart enougth, you should know the I already tought you how to pre-assign it, just give the value in the right hand side of the equal operator.

<pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
exampleVariable = "A sample string"
print(exampleVariable)
</pre>

Now you see the string inside the variable.

## A short quiz for you
1. Please define variables with pre-assigned any integer value
2. print out the value with variable

<pre data-executable="true" data-language="python">
